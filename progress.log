### 2025-05-21 (Update 11)
- Updated brand colors according to new brand guidelines:
  - Changed Vibrant Red from #e04646 to #3db9aa in the CSS variables
  - This update aligns with the teal-green color already used for the word "work" in the tagline
  - The change affects all elements using the --vibrant-red CSS variable, including:
    - Active cursor color
    - Ink splat animations
    - Mouse trail effects
  - The updated color provides a more cohesive visual identity across all brand touchpoints

### 2025-05-21 (Update 12)
- Made decorative blobs 6x smaller to improve visual balance:
  - Reduced main blob sizes from 1200px, 800px, 600px, and 1000px to 200px, 133px, 100px, and 167px respectively
  - Proportionally reduced tablet and mobile blob sizes
  - This change keeps the decorative elements visible but makes them less dominant on the page
  - The smaller blobs create a more subtle background effect that doesn't compete with the main content

### 2025-05-21 (Update 13)
- Improved blob animations by removing shape switching and enhancing morphing effects:
  - Replaced abrupt shape switching with smoother transformations
  - Added rotation animations to create more organic movement
  - Enhanced scaling animations with separate X and Y axis transformations
  - Used consistent blob shapes with transformations instead of switching between different shapes
  - These changes create a more subtle, fluid animation effect that's less distracting

### 2025-05-21 (Update 14)
